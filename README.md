## Introduction

Coding challenges are a great way to improve your problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. This repository contains solutions to a wide range of problems, organized into categories for ease of use. Each solution includes detailed explanations and can be found in the respective `Solution` files.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```

```

## Getting Started

To get started with the solutions in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akhildhiman7/problem-solving.git
   cd problem-solving
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired category and problem file**:
   ```bash
   cd strings
   ```

3. **Compile and run the solution**:
   Depending on the programming language used, compile the solution file. For example, if the solution is in C++:
   ```bash
   g++ problem1_solution.cpp -o solution
   ./solution
   ```

## Usage

Each solution is designed to be self-contained. To use a solution:

1. **Review the Solution file**: The `Solution` file contains the implementation of the solution. Review the code and comments for a better understanding.
2. **Run the solution**: Follow the instructions in the "Getting Started" section to compile and run the solution on your local machine.
